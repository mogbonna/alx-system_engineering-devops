## Description

This is a simple web infrastructure that hosts a website that is reachable via `www.foobar.com`. There are no firewalls or SSL certificates for protecting the server's network. Each component (database, application server) has to share the resources (CPU, RAM, and SSD) provided by the server.

## Specifics About This Infrastructure

- What a server is.<br/>A server is a computer that stores and shares data, serving requests from other computers. It is generally located in a data centre and it can be physical or virtual. It runs a operating system.

- The role of the domain name.<br/>The domain name directs users to a specific server's IP address, facilitating easy access to websites. To provide a human-friendly alias for an IP Address. The IP address and domain name alias is mapped in the Domain Name System (DNS)

- The type of DNS record `www` is in `www.foobar.com`.<br/>`www.foobar.com` uses an **A record**. This can be checked by running `dig www.foobar.com`.<br/>**Note:** the results might be different but for the infrastructure in this design, an **A** record is used.<br/>
  <i>Address Mapping record (A Record)â€”also known as a DNS host record, stores a hostname and its corresponding IPv4 address.</i>

- The role of the web server.<br/>The web server handles HTTP requests, serving web pages to users(static content).

- The role of the application server.<br/>The application server processes dynamic content and executes application logic.

- The role of the database.<br/>The database stores and retrieves data for the application.

- What the server uses to communicate with the client (computer of the user requesting the website).<br/>The server communicates with the user's computer using protocols like HTTP. Communication between the client and the server occurs over the internet network through the TCP/IP protocol suite.

## Issues With This Infrastructure

- SPOF (Single Point of Failure):<br/> A single component failure can disrupt the entire system. This server is a single point of failure because nothing is redundant.

- Downtime when maintenance needed.<br/>Downtime during maintenance, such as restarting the web server for deploying new code, interrupts service.

- Cannot scale if there's too much incoming traffic.<br/>It would be hard to scale this infrastructure becauses one server contains the required components. The server can quickly run out of resources or slow down when it starts receiving a lot of requests.
